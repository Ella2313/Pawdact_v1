Hii! My name is Gabriella i'm 14 years old and I'm from Kenya!
I'm an SDG Champion, Championing SDG 9, 14, and 15. And I really Love Animals!

My Project is a website called Pawdact The webiste is designed to help Children who love their
furry friends and would wish to know how to care for them and for those who would like to be Veterinary Doctors in the furure

I'm a kinesthetic Learner and would love to help other children who wish like me to become Veterinary Docotors in future through
Learning on how to take care of their furry friends while having fun!

I made my Project with HTML, CSS, Java Script and lots of Passion and Hard Work!

I really Struggled with CSS and Java Script as it was my first time using them but I learnt quite alot like Patience, Resilience and Hard Work!
